 * 2. Write a Java program to show lifecycle (creation, sleep, and dead) of a thread. Program 
should  print  randomly  the  name  of  thread  and  value  of  sleep  time.  The  name  of  the 
thread  should  be  hard  coded  through  constructor.  The  sleep  time  of  a  thread  will  be  a 
random integer in the range 0 to 4999.
